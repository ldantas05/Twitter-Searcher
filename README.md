# Twitter-Searcher

Created using twitter API, tkinter, tweepy and json. 
To work, credentials should be added to the credentials_template.py and renamed to credentlias.py.

This program opens a basic tkinter GUI which will receive username/keyword and count. Depending on the inputed value the user will click "Search by User" or "Search by Keyword" and the program will retrieve the latest tweets up to the number inputed in the "How many tweets to display?". 

The output for search by user will be a numbered list of tweets of the user. Output for "Search by Keyword" will be numbered list of tweets with the username.

Additional function will be added later.
